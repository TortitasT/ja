# Ja

A simple java package manager.

## Installation

With `wget`, this is the recommended way.

```bash
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tortitast/ja/master/install.sh | bash
```

With `go install`, fails often while trying to upgrade. And `init` subcommand
won't work.

```bash
go install github.com/tortitast/ja@latest
```

## Usage

```
ja help
```
